üìå Introduction

This project shows how cryptography may be used to secure data.  Users can utilize popular cryptographic algorithms to hash, encrypt, and decrypt files and text using an easy-to-use interface.  The software seeks to demonstrate the practical benefits of encryption in safeguarding data integrity and privacy.

üéØ Project Objectives

Put hashing, encryption, and decryption into practice for files and text.  
Support a variety of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography techniques.
Give consumers a straightforward, interactive interface so they can experiment and learn how each algorithm operates.

üèóÔ∏è Application Architecture and User Interface

 Streamlit, A browser-based UI framework based on Python, is used to create the application.  It divides features into tabs, such as:  

Encryption and Decryption of Text  
Encrypting and Decrypting files  
File and Text Hashing
Information from Algorithms  
üîí Cryptographic algorithms were implemented.  

üîê Symmetric Algorithms  

These both encrypt and decrypt using the same key.  

1.  Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES  

Kind: Symmetric  
Library: The Pycryptodome  
Use: File and text encryption and decryption
Note: Secure and widely used.  Blocks of encryption with a secret key.

2.  Data Encryption Standard, or DES  

Kind: Symmetric  
Library: The Pycryptodome
Use: Encrypting and decrypting text
Note: Older standard, primarily for educational reasons.
üîê Hashing Features They create fixed-size digests from data that cannot be decrypted.

3. The 256-bit Secure Hash Algorithm, or SHA-256

Library: Hashlib
Use: Text and file hashing‚Ä¢
Note: Frequently found in digital signatures and blockchain.

4. SHA-512

Library: Hashlib ‚Ä¢
Use: Text and file hashing‚Ä¢
Note: Greater collision resistance is achieved with a larger digest size.

5. MD5

Library: Hashlib.
Use: Secure but quick hashing
Note: Still helpful for fast file comparison and checksums.

6. BLAKE2b

Library: Hashlib.
Use: Quick and safe hashing
Note: Faster and more secure modern alternative to MD5/SHA.
